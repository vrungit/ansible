#By default, handlers run after all the tasks in a particular play have been completed. 
#This approach is efficient, because the handler only runs once, regardless of how many tasks notify it. 
#For example, if multiple tasks update a configuration file and notify a handler to restart Apache,
#Ansible only bounces Apache once to avoid unnecessary restarts.
#If you need handlers to run before the end of the play, add a task to flush them using the meta module,
#which executes Ansible actions.
